# atomizationFoam

## Features

- Volume-of-Fluid (VoF) solver for incompressible flows coupled with Lagrangian library
- Conversion of small VoF elements to Lagrangian parcels to reduce computational cost
- Support for
  - Particle-particle interaction (collision, coalescence) and secondary breakup
  - Adaptive mesh refinement
  - Fully parallelized
- Based on interIsoFoam in [OpenFOAM v2212](https://www.openfoam.com).

## Compilation

 1. Clone the `atomizationFoam` gitHub repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/imfd-stroemungsmechanik/atomizationFoam.git
```
 2. Use the `Allwmake` script to compile the `atomizationFoam` solver and its corresponding library:
```
./Allwmake
```

## Documentation

- Docs live in `docs/`. Generate API + guides with:
```
cd docs && doxygen Doxyfile
```
- Open `docs/build/html/index.html` in a browser.
- Start with `docs/usage.md`, `docs/components.md`, and `docs/examples/crossFlow.md`.
